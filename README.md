# 왜 만들었나요?
2B2T AE(현 2B2T AE&BE Game and Client Company)마인크래프트 서버의 부활판을 하나 만들려다가 NAT가 안되가지고 실패해서 그래서 이렇게 시스템을 독립시켰습니다

# Why was it created?
I Wanted to Create a Minecraft Server But i can't tcp portforward without NAT and Card(NGROK). however, i can't run a minecraft server Because i don't have a card and i am using Both IPv4 and IPv6 but i can't Portforward due to IPv6 Blocker on NAT!

# Run
